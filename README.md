# Spotify Clone (Logged-Out Version)

This isn't technically my first project, but it’s the first one I felt was good enough to upload here.

It’s a *frontend-only clone* of Spotify built with *HTML and CSS*. I aimed to make it as close to the original as possible, though there might be minor differences in fonts or layout. I'm still working on fixing bugs and improving responsiveness.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself with a real-world layout and test my HTML/CSS skills. It helped me learn a lot about positioning, spacing, and how large-scale UIs are structured.
