# Spotify Clone (Logged-Out Version)

This isn't technically my first project, but it’s the first one I felt was good enough to upload here.

It’s a *frontend-only clone* of Spotify built with *HTML and CSS*. I aimed to make it as close to the original as possible, though there might be minor differences in fonts or layout. I'm still working on fixing bugs and improving responsiveness.

## Currently

- HTML + CSS only  
- Logged-out version  
- No functionality yet (no login, no backend)

---

## Next Plans

- Add backend (login/signup system)  
- Make it fully responsive  
- Possibly use JavaScript for interactivity  

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself with a real-world layout and test my HTML/CSS skills. It helped me learn a lot about positioning, spacing, and how large-scale UIs are structured.

## Tech Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3

---

## Live Preview

Coming soon... (GitHub Pages or Netlify deployment planned)
